## Context
Vanguard, a leading investment management company, aimed to enhance the online process for clients through a more intuitive and modern UI, supplemented with timely in-context prompts. The primary goal was to determine if these changes led to a better user experience and higher process completion rates.

## Objectives
The key objectives of this analysis were:

1. To determine if the completion time for the test group differed from the completion time for the control group.
2. To check if the number of people who reached the confirmation step in the test group differed from the number of people who reached the confirmation step in the control group.
3. To assess if the gender distribution differs between the test group and the control group.
4. To evaluate if the average age of clients in the test group differs from the average age of clients in the control group.

## Data
The analysis was conducted on three datasets provided. After thorough data cleaning and concatenation, the datasets were utilized to facilitate hypothesis testing.

## Hypotheses and Statistical Tests
1. Completion Time Analysis
- Hypothesis: There is no significant difference in completion time between the test group and the control group.
- Test: Independent t-test.

2. Confirmation Step Analysis
- Hypothesis: There is no significant difference in the number of people reaching the confirmation step between the test group and the control group.
- Test: Z-test for proportions.

3. Gender Distribution Analysis
- Hypothesis: There is no significant difference in gender distribution between the test group and the control group.
- Test: Chi-square test.

4. Age Analysis
- Hypothesis: There is no significant difference in the average age of clients between the test group and the control group.
- Test: Independent t-test

## Results 
For all the hypotheses tested, we failed to reject the null hypothesis. This indicates that while there were differences in the metrics between the test and control groups, these differences were not statistically significant.

## Conclusion
This analysis provided insights into the impact of a new UI and in-context prompts on Vanguard's client process completion rates and user experience. Although the changes showed some differences, they were not statistically significant.
